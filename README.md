# Titanic Kaggle Competition Solution

This repository contains my solution for the Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition on Kaggle. The goal of this competition is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features.

## Overview

- **Competition Link**: [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

## Contents

- `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that walk through the data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation steps of the solution.
- `data/`: Here you can find the dataset files provided by Kaggle (train.csv, test.csv) and any additional processed data files.
- `submissions/`: This is where you can find the CSV files containing the predictions for the test set. These files can be submitted to Kaggle for evaluation.
- `README.md`: You are reading it! This file provides an overview of the repository and its contents.

## Methodology

1. **Data Exploration**: I started by exploring the dataset to understand its structure, missing values, and potential relationships between features.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: I performed data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and creating new features.
3. **Feature Engineering**: I extracted meaningful information from the existing features and created new features that might improve model performance.
4. **Model Selection**: I experimented with various machine learning algorithms and selected the ones that performed best for this specific problem.
5. **Model Evaluation**: I evaluated the models using appropriate evaluation metrics and techniques like cross-validation to prevent overfitting.
6. **Submission**: Once satisfied with the model's performance, I generated predictions on the test set and submitted the results to Kaggle.
